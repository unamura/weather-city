# Weather City
[![Java]]
## Web app to check the weather

The project aims to recreate a simple weather site. So by searching for a city or, eventually, a smaller lesser known place it should give back the weather and other useful information about the place.

## How it works
The app simply works by retrieving places and weather data using the online free available [Nominatim Openstreetmap](https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Overview/) and [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/current) API.
